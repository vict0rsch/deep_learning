For more general knowledge regarding Machine/Deep Learning, have a look at **[useful_resources.md](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/useful_resources.md)**. \r\n\r\nLasagne and Keras are Theano-based so I recommend you get familiar with Theano before starting these ones.  \r\n\r\nHowever **Keras** is way closer to usual Python than Lasagne so it requires a weaker understanding of Theano. The main thing to understand to get started with Keras is Theano's graph structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe concentrate, in [theano.md](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/Deep-Learning/blob/master/theano.md), on a few features of Theano that will be needed in Lasagne mostly and just a little in Keras. You will not learn Theano there but get a glimpse at how it works and how it can be used in a Deep Learning context. Theano is about much more than this, especially regarding [GPU](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html) calculation and [Automatic Differenciation](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/gradients.html).\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the official Theano tutorial [here](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/).\r\n\r\nI have not worked a lot with Convolutional Networks so I won't mention them here, for now.\r\n\r\n| Set up  | Theano   | Keras | Lasagne |Recurrent| Resources | Lose Time |\r\n|:---------:|:----------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|\r\n|[![i1][setup-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/setup.md)|[![i2][theano-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/theano.md)|[![i3][keras-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/keras)|[![i4][lasagne-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/lasagne)|[![i6][recurrent-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/recurrent.md)| [![i5][resources-image]](https://github.com/Vict0rSch/deep_learning/useful_resources.md) |[![i6][time-image]](http://9gag.com/)|\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n---\r\nMachine learning is a vast area.

The concept is easy: pick up your toothbrush, a pen or a spoon and walk it through your code as if they understood it. Better yet use a friend or coworker: you won't need their brain, rather their ears. \r\n\r\nThe thing is that debugging can be hard and the error might very well be silly. However looking as someone else's code is often hard and/or laborious, so asking a friend/coworker to debug it is hardly possible.  \r\nOn the other hand, explaining it to your toothbrush makes you rethink the whole coding process you went through and hopefully find that (silly?) mistake or incoherence. \r\n\r\nContact [Clément](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl%C3%A9ment-nicolle-18ba2267) to learn more.\r\n\r\n<br> \r\n\r\n<sub>Icons made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) from [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com) licensed by [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n[theano-image]: http://s18.postimg.org/cuim8chtx/four56.png\r\n[resources-image]: http://s22.postimg.org/6alksj4t9/idea14.png\r\n[lasagne-image]: http://s24.postimg.org/5sotgm269/stack13.png\r\n[keras-image]: http://s12.postimg.org/xvsdbaepl/unicorn.png\r\n[setup-image]: http://s2.postimg.org/hgrwawlid/three115.png\r\n[time-image]: http://s22.postimg.org/y0v2jhcf1/clock164.png\r\n[recurrent-image]: http://s12.postimg.org/fdm1mirux/graph16.png\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
