# Deep-Learning


How to use
---

This repository contains Deep Learning tutorials. 
Lasagne and Keras are Theano-based so I recommend you get familiar with Theano before starting these ones.  

However **Keras** is way closer to usual Python than Lasagne so it requires a weaker understanding of Theano. The main thing to understand to get started with Keras is Theano's graph structure.


This is just a quick and easy intro. Theano is about much more than this. Especially regarding [GPU](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/using_gpu.html) calculation and [Automatic Differenciation](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/gradients.html).

We concentrate here on a few features of Theano that will be needed in Lasagne mostly and just a little in Keras. You will not learn Theano here but get a glimpse at how it works and how it can be used in a Deep Learning context.

Installations

### Theano
<http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install>

### Lasagne
<http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/stable/user/installation.html>

### Keras
<http://keras.io/#installation>  
Keras can use either Theano or Google's Tensorflow as a processing backend. I have not tried Tensorflow so everything I say might or not be portable to the Tensorflow backend. My feeling is that it is.
